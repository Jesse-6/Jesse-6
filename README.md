- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jesse-6.
- 👀 I’m interested in gaining experience over Linux environments and projects, to help develop over both C and Assembly language on them.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and also Assembly language (as always), and seeking to learn about kernel development and UEFI (which I actually know nothing about the last).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source projects that values lightning fast code, those who don't care about mixing assembly code to gain performance.
- 📫 You can reach me only here for now.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/Supreme Lord of the Universe :D
- ⚡ Fun fact: Despite still learning assembly, I must admit that I'm already very skilled on it, enough to develop a kernel on the legacy BIOS era.
